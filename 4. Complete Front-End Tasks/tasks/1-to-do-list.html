	Task 1: To-Do List

	Task Objective:
	Your interface will contain two parts: a to-do task list, and a new task input area.
	
	1. Your task list will contain several tasks one after another. Each task will have the task name and two buttons: Check and Delete
		- The "check" button is to signify that the task is done. You can use a checkbox as well, but the important factor is that the
		corresponding task's formatting should be different, to indicate that it is completed. The user should also be able to "uncheck" the task.
		- The "delete" button will remove the task from the task list. You can maybe add a confirmation alert to prevent accidental deletions.
	
	2. Your task input area should have an input field for a task, and a button to add it.
		- You can also add extra things for aesthetic purposes like a label, placeholder, etc.
	
	3. When your task input has a valid input (non-empty input, if you want to, you can restrict the length too), the input field will be cleared and
	the task will be added to the task list.

	Your task will be judged on the functioning of the application and the styling of the components. A very show-off or glamorous interface is not what we expect,
	but just a neat user interface using which is not a hassle is well-appreciated.
