	Task 2: Timer Application

	Note: If you have used Timers in your phone's clock app, or in any other place. You can guess how this will proceed.

	Task Objective:
	1. An input will be taken to see how long the timer should run for. The input should ideally be in the format of HH:MM:SS
		- You can either use different input fields or use the same input field and process the data acquired.
	
	2. Once an input (a valid input) is given, a timer will be generated, which will count down to zero.
	
	3. The timer should also have a pause/resume button and a delete/stop button. The pause button will be used to pause and resume the timer appropriately, 
	while the stop/delete button will reset the timer.
	
	4. When the time runs out in the timer, alert the user with either a sound being played, a change in the visual style of the timer or some other cues.
	
	5. While you can start with a single timer, it would be preferable if your application can run upto 6 timers at once.

	While your task will be judged on how you have applied the functionality, your task will also be jedged on the styles you have used.
